Directives
----------

```html
<div ay-accordion-root multiple>
  <div ay-accordion open on-toggle="ctrl.accordionToggle(state)">
    <b ay-accordion-header>Panel 1 (Click to open)</b>
    <div>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```


### ayAccordionRoot

This directive wraps the entire accordion, as well as any content below the
accordion that needs to be pushed down when accordion sections open and close.

* `multiple`: This attribute allows multiple accordion sections to be open at
  the same time (default is only a single section expanded at a time).

### ayAccordion

This directive manages a single expanding/collapsing accordion section,
including the title content shown when it is collapsed.

* `open`: This attribute will make the section expanded by default. You can
  also use `ng-open` to set this attribute dynamically.

* `on-toggle`: This attribute specifies a callback function to be run when the
  section is expanded or collapsed. The `state` argument is a boolean
  representing if the section is open.

### ayAccordionHeader

This directive wraps the title of the accordion section, and attaches the event
handlers to expand the section when clicked.


Styling
-------

For the accordion to expand/collapse as intended, you'll need to add something
like the following to your stylesheet:

```css
[ay-accordion] {
    overflow: hidden;
    height: 30px;
}

[ay-accordion][open] {
    height: auto;
}
```
