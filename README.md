### ay-accordion-root

This web component wraps the entire accordion, as well as any content below the accordion that needs to be pushed down when accordion sections open and close.

* `multiple`: This attribute allows multiple accordion sections to be open at
  the same time (default is only a single section expanded at a time).

### ay-accordion

TThis web component manages a single expanding/collapsing accordion section, including the title content shown when it is collapsed.

* `open`: This attribute will make the section expanded by default.

* `disabled`: This attribute will disable the open/close ability of the accordion. The accordion will still maintain its original state open/close.

### ay-accordion-header

This web component wraps the title of the accordion section, and attaches the event handlers to expand the section when clicked.
